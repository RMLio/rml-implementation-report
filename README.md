# RML Implementation report 

## Add new RML processor
Do the following steps to a new RML processor to the implementation report.

1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone or download the test-cases: https://github.com/RMLio/rml-test-cases
3. Run them over the processor and create a CSV file called `results.csv` with the results. 
An example of such a CSV file can be found [here](https://github.com/RMLio/rml-implementation-report/blob/master/tools-report/rmlmapper/results.csv).
4. Create a folder in the `tools-report` folder with the name of the processor.
5. Copy `results.csv` in the newly created folder.
6. Make a pull request to this repo with the information of your tool: name, version, test date, contact and web page. 
7. Once the pull request is merged the results are available at the [RML implementation report web page](https://rml.io/implementation-report/). 

## Update existing RML processor
Do the following steps to update an RML processor that is already in the implementation report.

1. Fork this repo.
2. Update `results.csv` file in the processor's folder in `tools-report`.
3. Make a pull request to this repo with the updated information of your tool: version, test date, contact and web page. 
4. Once the pull request is merged the results are available at the [RML implementation report web page](https://rml.io/implementation-report/).
